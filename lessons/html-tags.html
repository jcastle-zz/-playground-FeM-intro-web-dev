    <h1>This is a header</h1>
    <!-- Can have multiple H1, various levels for various sizes and importance. Goes down to H6. The browser has defaults to what an H1 should look like. With CSS we can make these look and act differently. 
    
    It's important to use the proper tags for accessibility. Developers should use good practices to use the right tags. Tags signify sections and importance. It's good for documentation for future self. Write code that makes sense.

    Tags with < />. Some are self closing and not all need closing slash.

    There about 350 HTML tags, usually use only about 50. 

    Headings - H1 to H6. Title, important descriptors at varying levels. Squishy subjects, no right way to do this, mostly artistic engineering. 

    P tags. Put paragraphs of text inside the P tag. Can have multiple P tags. Whatever you put inside a paragraph, only text. Can't have a div or h1. Can have spans.

    Anchor tags - <a href=""></a>. Used for links. href is considered an attribute.

    Div - short for division. Divs as cardboard boxes, never the important part, it's whats inside. Div has no semantic meaning, doesn't mean anything because it's inside a div. Going to use them everywhere. Generic tag for grouping things together. Useful for styling with CSS. 

    Span - like a ziplock bag. Used inside paragraphs. Small snippets of anything. Can use in H1s, paragraphs, etc.

    ol, ul, li - ordered list, unordered list, list item. 

    img - used for images. Needs a src. <img src="" /> Give it an alt so screen reader has some text to say about it. Alt doubles as a screen reader if the image doesn't show. Every image tag should have an alt. Alt tags important for search engines.

    inputs - for forms. <input />. Numbers, dates, checkboxes, text, etc.

    Textarea - <textarea></textarea> - larger input accommodating text. Don't use them vary often. Good for long form text from a user.

    select - choose from a dropdown, options. <select></select>. Used for selecting options.

    form - used as a container for all elements in a form. Use for inputs, textarea, select, etc.

    tables - before CSS, used tables in html. Haven't used tables in a decade. Still use tables if you have a table of data but don't use them for websites. TR is a row, TD is a cell.

    Other useful ones - nav, footer, article. Article is useful for scrapers, large sections of text.
